## Fostering a dog with heartworms?

Tobias is currently undergoing treatment for heartworms while in foster care, so with some extra time on his hands he’s decided to address some FAQs about the treatment process.

## Can I care for a dog with heartworms if I have other animals?

Yes! Heartworms are not contagious. Dogs (and cats, humans, ferrets, wolves, foxes, etc.) can only get heartworms by being bitten by an infected mosquito. Since heartworms require mosquitoes for transmission, a dog (or cat, etc.) cannot get heartworms directly from another dog. Heartworms are endemic to this area, with Mississippi and Louisiana leading the country in heartworm infection rates. All pets should be on year-round heartworm prevention, which is highly effective at protecting them.

## Can people be infected?

Technically yes, however in the rare occasion that a human is infected with heartworms, the parasite will die off since it is unable to survive in a human body.

## Will I see worms in my dog’s feces?

No! Heartworms live in a dog’s pulmonary arteries, lungs, & heart. Since heartworms do not live in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, they are not found in feces. The only way to know if your pet has heartworm disease is through a blood test.

## What is the general treatment timeline & what is involved?

Treatment occurs over several months and mostly involves giving oral meds and keeping dogs on exercise restriction at home. Dogs will need to be brought into the clinic approx. 2-4 times over the course of treatment to receive injections and get general testing/check-ups.

- Step 1: Pre-treatment (killing the baby worms (microfilariae)/weakening the adult worms): Before receiving treatment to kill the adult worms, dogs should be on a monthly heartworm preventative (ex. Heartgard, Sentinel) for at least 2 months and have taken an antibiotic (typically doxycycline) every day for 30 days. Doxycycline is given to eliminate Wolbachia, a bacteria that lives inside heartworms. Eliminating Wolbachia helps to reduce the dog’s immune response to the dead heartworms and disrupts heartworm transmission. Dogs should also begin exercise restriction. Sometimes pre-treatment is done at the shelter. *They should continue to take a preventative for the rest of their lives
- Step 2: Treating the adult worms: Dogs typically receive a series of 3 injections of melarsomine to kill the adult heartworms. Melarsomine (Immiticide®) is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult heartworm infection in dogs. It‘s administered at a vet clinic and given as an injection in the lumbar muscles. One month after the first injection, two additional injections of melarsomine are given 24 hours apart. Your dog may need to stay overnight at the clinic for the last 2 injections, but sometimes they can go home in between the 2nd & 3rd injections. *The 8 weeks after the 1st injection are typically when dogs are fostered, but this can vary case by case -After the injections are given, dogs may also go home with oral medications. For example prednisone is used to minimize complications from dying heartworms. Dogs may also be given medication for pain (the injections can be painful) and to help keep them calm.
- Step 3: Post-treatment (after the 3rd injection): Continue exercise restriction for 6 to 8 weeks -A microfilariae (baby worm) test should be performed 1 month after the last injection
-An antigen test should be performed 6-9 months after the last injection

## Why do they need exercise restriction?

Exercise increases oxygen demand which increases cardiac workload and results in increased blood flow to the lungs. As the worms die they get absorbed by the bloodstream slowly over several weeks to months. During this process, the debris from dead and dying worms can create emboli (clots) that clog the dog’s arteries and lungs. Because exercise increases blood flow to the lungs, it increases the likelihood that dead worms will block blood flow (i.e. be pushed into the smaller blood vessels of the lung, causing pulmonary thromboemboli). Exercise can also cause the dead/dying worms to break apart more quickly, also causing emboli. This can result in heart and/or lung damage, heart failure, and even death. You basically don’t want to add to the workload of an already taxed/damaged heart and/or lungs or increase the damage caused by dead/dying worms. *Exercise restriction is the most important for the 8 weeks after the 1st melarsomine injection
What exactly does exercise restriction entail?
The most important point is to keep your dog calm and quiet so that their heart rate stays low. So definitely no playing with other dogs, running, jumping, or long walks. Dogs can go outside on leash to do their business and sniff around for a few minutes. Mental enrichment is key. You can keep them busy with kongs, puzzle toys, lickimats, yak chews, etc. You can even read to them or work on some obedience training as long as they don’t get too excited, such as teaching or strengthening the “sit” and “stay” commands. They should be kept in a crate or small area when they are not being supervised. -This is a great time to have a TV or movie marathon with your dog. These are also great dogs to foster if you don’t have a lot of space, or don’t have the time to keep up with a normally active dog

## What should I watch for during treatment?

- Cough, especially a cough that results in vomiting, a wet cough, coughing up blood, or passing out
- Difficulty breathing
- Fever
- Nosebleed
- Lethargy
- Pale gums

*On the day that they receive the injection and for a couple of days after they may cry/whine and have a decreased appetite as the injection can be painful and just generally cause them to not feel well. They may get pain medication such as gabapentin which can help, and you can also try giving them chicken and rice. Their back may be sore so take care around that area as well.

## Can dogs go on to live healthy lives after treatment?

Yes! With proper treatment, most dogs will recover from heartworm disease and go on to live a full, healthy life. By fostering a dog with heartworms you are helping to save that dog’s life plus opening up a space at the shelter for another dog.
